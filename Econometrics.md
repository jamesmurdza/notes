## Simple and multiple regression analysis:
> **Example:** To ***understand the relationship between a student's test scores and the number of hours studied***, a researcher collects data on test scores (dependent variable) and hours studied (independent variable) for a sample of students. The researcher can then estimate a regression model to quantify the effect of hours studied on test scores, test hypotheses about the relationship, and assess the model's goodness of fit.

## Violations of classical assumptions:
> **Example:** Suppose we are examining the relationship between a person's income (dependent variable) and their level of education (independent variable). If the ***variance of the error term in the regression model increases with income*** (heteroscedasticity), violating the classical assumption of homoscedasticity, we would need to employ robust standard errors or transform the data to address this issue.

## Panel data analysis:
> **Example:** A researcher is interested in studying the impact of government policies on economic growth across different countries over time. By collecting data on GDP growth (dependent variable), policy variables, and country-specific characteristics for multiple countries observed annually, the researcher can employ panel data analysis techniques, such as fixed effects or random effects models, to ***control for time-invariant and time-varying unobserved heterogeneity***.

## Limited dependent variable models:
> **Example:** Suppose we want to analyze the factors influencing a consumer's choice between two competing products: Product A or Product B. The dependent variable represents the choice (A or B), and the independent variables could include price, advertising expenditure, and consumer demographics. The researcher can estimate a multinomial logit model to ***model and predict the probability of choosing each product*** based on these factors.

## Instrumental variables and causal inference:
> Example: To ***estimate the causal effect of education on earnings***, a researcher might face endogeneity due to unobserved ability or motivation. By using an instrumental variable, such as proximity to a college or university, which affects education but is unrelated to ability or motivation, the researcher can employ instrumental variables estimation to obtain consistent estimates of the causal effect of education on earnings.
