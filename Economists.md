Scottish economist
- Wrote An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations in 1776, considered "the first modern work of economics"
	- “In regards to the price of commodities, the rise of wages operates as simple interest does, the rise of profit operates like compound interest."
	- “It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.”
- Stance: Corporations are not concerned with the common good.:

## David Ricardo

## Karl Marx

## Alfred Marshall
- ***Law of diminishing marginal utility*** explains the decreasing satisfaction individuals derive from consuming additional units of a good

## Irving Fisher
- Wrote The Theory of Interest as Determined by Impatience to Spend Income and Opportunity to Invest It
	- “A bond price, for example, will grow with accrued interest between two coupon cuttings. That growth in its value is not income but increase of capital. Only when the coupon is detached does the bond render, or give off, a service, and so yield income."
- Wrote The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions

## John Maynard Keynes
- During economic downturns, governments should increase public spending to stimulate demand and create employment opportunities.
- Expectations and confidence play a crucial role in shaping economic outcomes.
	- "Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."
- Importance of managing aggregate demand through monetary and fiscal policies to maintain stable economic growth and avoid prolonged recessions.
- "Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some defunct economist."
- "If you owe your bank a hundred pounds, you have a problem. But if you owe a million, it has."
- "The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones."

## Friedrich Hayek
- Centrally planned economies inevitably lead to a loss of individual liberty and economic efficiency, as they undermine the price system's ability to coordinate resources.
	- “If socialists understood economics they wouldn't be socialists.”
	- “The more the state "plans" the more difficult planning becomes for the individual.”
- Excessive government intervention in the economy stifles innovation and economic growth and creates a fertile ground for authoritarianism.
	- “Fascism is the stage reached after communism has proved an illusion.”

## Joan Robinson
- “The purpose of studying economics is not to acquire a set of ready-made answers to economic questions, but to learn how to avoid being deceived by economists.”
- “The misery of being exploited by capitalists is nothing compared to the misery of not being exploited all.”

## Daniel Kahneman
- Wrote Thinking, Fast and Slow in 2011
	- "Familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."
	- "In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature."
	- "When in a good mood, people become more intuitive and more creative but also less vigilant and more prone to logical errors."

## Thomas Piketty
- Wrote Capital in the Twenty-First Century
	- “When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.”
	- “Over a long period of time, the main force in favor of greater equality has been the diffusion of knowledge and skills.”
	- "Wealth is so concentrated that a large segment of society is virtually unaware of its existence."

## John Kenneth Galbraith
- “The world of finance hails the invention of the wheel over and over again, often in a slightly more unstable version. All financial innovation involves in one form or another, the creation of debt secured in greater or lesser adequacy by real assets.”
